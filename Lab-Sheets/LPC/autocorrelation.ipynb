    "In the [previous notebook](./correlation.ipynb) we have only directly correlated two signals (of the same length) and only directly correlated a signal with itself.\n",
    "\n",

    "One of the many examples for when we need this knowledge is LPC based speech signal analysis.\n",
    "As a result we don't want to know the correlation between two signals $x[i]$ and $y[i]$ but the (auto-)correlation between $x[i]$ and $x[i-k]$, the time-shifted version of $x[i]$.\n",

    "We define the *autocorrelation function estimate* at a time shift $k$ of the signal $x[i]$ of length $L$ as\n",

    "for all values of $k$ from $0$ to $L-1$, i.e., for each $k$ we correlate the non-shifted signal with a signal shifted by $k$ samples.\n",
    "We observe that the first sum is not well defined as  $x[i+k]$ is unknown for $i+k>L$.\n",
    "However, in these cases in general, signals are assumed to have infinitely many zeros before and after the actual data; we call this *zero-padding*.\n",
    "Therefore, we can stop the sum at index $L-k$ since $y[i]$ becomes zero after that point.\n",
    "The normalization must still be performed with the intended length $L$.\n",
    "Hence, the right equality holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* Since we correlate the signal with (a shifted version of) itself it does not matter whether we shift a signal by $k$ or by $-k$.\n",
    "If the second signal is shifted by $k$ relative to the first, the first is shifted by $-k$ relative to the second.\n",
