    "### Butterworth Filter Design\n",
    "\n",
    "To actually design a filter we can use then function `butter()` from `scipy`'s `signal` libary which calculates filter coefficients $a_n$ and $b_m$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that our tolerace scheme is fullfilled we have to know, how many coefficients $a_n$, for $0 \\leq n \\leq p$ and $b_m$, for $0 \\leq m \\leq q$ (as defined below the [schematic](#IIR-filter-structure) depicted at the top of this Notebook) the `butter()` method needs to achieve this. If we assume to have as many forward coefficients $b_m$ as feedback path coefficients $a_n$, i.e. $p=q$ we define the order of the filter as being $p$ (or $q$). The function `buttord()` takes our tolerance scheme (values) and calculates to required filter order $N$. Furthermore, the function `buttord()` returns the [cut-off frequnecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutoff_frequency) of the filter, a.k.a. natural frequency and therefore the variable name `Wn` is used below (if we would denote this frequency by $f_c$ this would lead to confusion with the center frequency $f_c$). The cut-off frequency is defined as the frequency at which the frequency response is decayed by $3 \\,\\mathrm{dB}$ ($=1/\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.71$)."
