    "When processing signals with long duration, it is common practise to do so by splitting the long signal into a series of shorter segments or chunks, a.k.a. frames. This is primarily for three reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> First, dealing with the full signal 'in one go' might be impractical due to constraints in computational memory (especially if you have to implement algorithms on ressource-limited hardware, such as r.g. microcontrollers). \n",
    "</li> \n",
    "<li> Second, to attain useful inference from operations such as the discrete Fourier Transform, it is assumed that the signal under scrutiny is time invariant (i.e its statistical properties do not vary with time). This is only typically true when analysing signals over short time frames. \n",
